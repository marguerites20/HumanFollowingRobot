# HumanFollowingRobot
 The goal of this project is to create a human following robot that tracks and follows the motion of a humanâ€™s hand. The robot will detect hand movement using IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor. With distance measured and motion detected the robot will follow the movement of the object. 
 
In an effort to protect the robot and add complexity to the project, the robot has been designed to keep distance between itself and the object. If the object lunges at the robot or robot drives too close it will reverse in an attempt to distance itself from the object before promptly attempting to follow it once more.
